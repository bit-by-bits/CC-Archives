### Code-Forces-Solutions
Beginner c++ codes for ease-to-medium level practice questions. <br>
Initially created to track my own competitive programming journey.

### How To Use
1. Clone the repository to a local system.
2. Refer to the code inside by matching the particular file names with (for eg. CodeForces) questions.

<strong>Note :</strong> You might even view it online on [GitHub](https://github.com/bit-by-bits/CC-Archives). <br>
Also, a better approach is to read the code halfway and take hints to solve it instead of copying it directly.
